Inspired by my js13k game, I sought to make a minesweeper clone.

# Installation

Remember to `npm install` and `tsc compile` (so that tsc can generate a .js file). Also, files will need to be in the appropiate locations.

Should totally write documentation for my Phaser Typescript template and automate its installation.
